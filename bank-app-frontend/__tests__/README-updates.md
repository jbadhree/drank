# Frontend Test Suite Updates

## Completed Tests

1. UI Components:
   - `Spinner.test.tsx` - Full test suite with 7 passing tests covering size, color, and combinations

2. App Pages:
   - `page.test.tsx` - Tests for the main page component with 3 passing tests
   - `login.test.tsx` - Tests for the login page with 5 passing tests

## Remaining Work

1. API and Auth Tests:
   - The API tests were started but have issues with mocking axios
   - The Auth tests were started but have issues with the hooks testing mechanics

## Recommendations for Fixing API Tests

1. Use a more direct mocking approach with manual module factories:
   ```javascript
   // In the test file
   jest.mock('@/lib/api', () => ({
     login: jest.fn(),
     getCurrentUser: jest.fn(),
     // ... other functions
   }));
   
   // Then in tests
   import { login } from '@/lib/api';
   login.mockResolvedValue({ token: 'test-token', user: mockUser });
   ```

2. For testing hooks like `useAuth`, consider using a simpler testing pattern:
   ```javascript
   // Mock dependencies at the top of file
   jest.mock('@/lib/api', () => ({
     getCurrentUser: jest.fn(),
   }));
   
   // In the test
   getCurrentUser.mockResolvedValue(mockUser);
   const { result } = renderHook(() => useAuth());
   ```

3. Use the `--coverage` flag to see which parts of the code are covered by tests:
   ```
   npm test -- --coverage
   ```

4. Prioritize testing the UI components that the user interacts with directly, since they provide the most value in terms of catching regressions.

## Running Tests

You can continue to run individual tests with:
```
npm test __tests__/components/ui/Spinner.test.tsx
```

Or run a specific group of tests:
```
npm test __tests__/app
```

## Adding More Tests

When adding new tests, follow the patterns established in the successful test files:
1. Group related tests with `describe`
2. Use clear, descriptive test names
3. Mock only what's necessary
4. Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details
